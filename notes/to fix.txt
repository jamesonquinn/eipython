Pseudovoters (both kinds grr)



math

check that jacobian of alphas and betas is 1



Coding

un-ickify sigma nu #Done?

Subtract out pseudovoters after sampling #Done?????

Importance-weight the samples #Done??????????????

Fix jacobian of polytopize in code #Done?

Figure out how to get jacobian correction to pyro without stupid uniform distributions #Fuck it.

estimate variance of likelihood of log using both sides, not just one.

subtract off mean of nuhats before continuing to estimate sigma_nu
