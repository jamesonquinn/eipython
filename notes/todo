do calculus for optimal transport batch size

ch2:
#Foreground marginal/conditional graph
  make graph

Explain SDD thing better
  #-in 2T
  #in multisite
  #-more parameters is a tradeoff; partly good as long as it's not quadratic
  #-explain renormalization: teaser
    #-in appendix
  #-talk about saddle points and point out how it's actually good in theory
    #-in the example
    in the appendix
