check that conditional sampling works (emprirically)

write more unit tests

check optimal transport vs non

do calculus for optimal transport batch size





..................... August

I switched infoToM's default to strong=True for chapter 3. Check to ensure that didn't cause worse results in ch 2.


....
Writing:

ch2:
#Foreground marginal/conditional graph
  make graph

Explain SDD thing better
  #-in 2T
  #in multisite
  #-more parameters is a tradeoff; partly good as long as it's not quadratic
  #-explain renormalization: teaser
    #-in appendix
  #-talk about saddle points and point out how it's actually good in theory
    #-in the example
    in the appendix

Results


ch3:
prior work

explain NC model and procedure

results


....... September

Get numbers for multisite

4 solutions:
laplace: record or reconstruct Hessian
ideal laplace: iterate between find mode, find Hessian
meanfield: run it. (Unamortized, for now)
  amortize it later
ideal meanfield: get mean and covariance, then precision, then drop non-diagonal precision.

get KL divergences

get coverages
